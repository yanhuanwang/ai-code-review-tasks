## 🎯 Purpose

These tasks were created to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-based code review assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot and Codeium) in practical software engineering workflows. Each task is a self-contained Python file designed to simulate real-world issues encountered during code review.

The dataset was used in a controlled study involving senior/principal developers to assess:

- Review time and efficiency
- Bug detection performance
- Developer trust and perception of AI tools
